### Package website modes

Epiverse-TRACE packages use the [`{pkgdown}` package](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/) to generate websites. `{pkgdown}` provides [development modes](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/reference/build_site.html#development-mode) (specified by a package's [`_pkgdown.yml` file](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/articles/customise.html)) to generate different sites for the development and released versions of your package.

When the package is not yet on CRAN, we use the `unreleased` development mode. In this case, we use a visual element to highlight the package development version in red. An example is the [website for `{superspreading}`](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/superspreading/) and its associated `_pkgdown` [configuration](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/superspreading/blob/main/_pkgdown.yml#L12-L13).

After the package is accepted on CRAN, we switch to `auto` mode, which provides two versions of the website: `release` and `devel`. Here, an example is the `{cfr}`package [website](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/cfr/), which is configured [here](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/cfr/blob/main/_pkgdown.yml#L5-L6). We use this configuration for the CRAN packages because we expect most users to install the package from CRAN and so we direct them to the CRAN site associated with the current release. The additional `devel` option here allows users to manually switch to it if they installed the development version from GitHub.
